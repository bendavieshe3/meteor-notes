Notes is a 'sticky note' application that allows the user to arrange sticky notes on a web page. 

Starting Out
------------

To follow along, you need to have Meteor installed. Follow the instructions at http://docs.meteor.com to get it. 

    curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh 

Create your project using the normal method. Open a terminal, navigate the folder you wish to *contain* the application folder and execute the `meteor create` command:

    cd ~/meteor-apps
    meteor create notes

This command creates the application folder and initial meteor. You can immediately run the application as it says:
    
    cd notes
    meteor

Go ahead and open the application in one or more browsers (by default, this will be at http://localhost:3000) The application as it gets created doesn't do much. You will want to leave meteor running and enter further meteor commands in another terminal window. This will mean that all HTML, JavaScript, CSS and data changes will be pushed to your owner browser session(s). 

If you have the initial application running we can move on.
